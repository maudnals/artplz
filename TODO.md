- Dali Bug (not an artist page, land on disambiguation)

**Features:**

- Random artist instead of always Van Gogh
- "Continue" mode
- Bigger/Smaller image? Better viewportfit? Center?
- Add frame
- Display animation WHILE img load
- Mode with artist as command line argument
- Fail more gracefully: if no artwork list but it's an artist, take image from page.
- [DONE] When "enter" (empty input), pick an artist instead of ""\nOh no, that's empty or contains special characters ðŸ˜³. Try again!\n"
- [DONE] Mode without manual input for artist (just pick one!)
